        No single food — not even a superfood — can offer all the nutrition,
        health benefits, and energy we need to nourish ourselves. The 2015–2020
        US Dietary Guidelines recommend healthy eating patterns, &quot;combining
        healthy choices from across all food groups — while paying attention to
        calorie limits&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, research has shown that healthy dietary patterns can
        reduce risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and certain
        cancers. Dietary patterns such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop
        Hypertension) diet and the Mediterranean diet, which are mostly
        plant-based, have demonstrated significant health benefits and reduction
        of chronic disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are a few foods that can be singled out for special
        recognition. These &quot;superfoods&quot; offer some very important
        nutrients that can power-pack your meals and snacks, and further enhance
        a healthy eating pattern.
      </p>

          <h3>Berries</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/berries.jpg" alt="Berries" width="400" />
          </div>
          <p>
            High in fiber, berries are naturally sweet, and their rich colors
            mean they are high in antioxidants and disease-fighting nutrients.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>How to include them: </em>When berries are not in season, it is
            just as healthy to buy them frozen. Add to yogurt, cereals, and
            smoothies, or eat plain for a snack.
          </p>

          <h3>Fish</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/fish.jpg" alt="Fish" width="400" />
          </div>
            <p>
              Fish can be a good source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids,
              which help prevent heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>How to include it: </em>Buy fresh, frozen, or canned fish.
              Fish with the highest omega-3 content are salmon, tuna steaks,
              mackerel, herring, trout, anchovies, and sardines.

          <h3>Leafy greens</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/greens.jpg" alt="Leafy greens" width="400" />
          </div>
            <p>
              Dark, leafy greens are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and
              calcium, as well as several phytochemicals (chemicals made by
              plants that have a positive effect on your health). They also add
              fiber into the diet.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>How to include them: </em>Try varieties such as spinach, swiss
              chard, kale, collard greens, or mustard greens. Throw them into
              salads or sauté them in a little olive oil. You can also add
              greens to soups and stews.

          <h3>Nuts</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/nuts.jpeg" alt="Nuts" width="400" />
          </div>
            <p>
              Hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, pecans — nuts are a good source of
              plant protein. They also contain monounsaturated fats, which may
              be a factor in reducing the risk of heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>How to include them: </em>Add a handful to oatmeal or yogurt
              or have as a snack. But remember they are calorically dense, so
              limit to a small handful. Try the various types of nut butters
              such as peanut (technically a legume), almond, or cashew. Nuts are
              also a great accompaniment to cooked veggies or salads.

          <h3>Olive oil</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/oil.jpg" alt="Olive oil" width="400" />
          </div>
            <p>
              Olive oil is a good source of vitamin E, polyphenols, and
              monounsaturated fatty acids, all which help reduce the risk of
              heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>How to include it: </em>Use in place of butter or margarine in
              pasta or rice dishes. Drizzle over vegetables, use as a dressing,
              or when sautéing.
            </p>

          <h3>Whole grains</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/grains.jpg" alt="Whole grains" width="400" />
          </div>
            <p>
              A good source of both soluble and insoluble fiber, whole grains
              also contain several B vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients.
              They have been shown to lower cholesterol and protect against
              heart disease and diabetes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>How to include them: </em>Try having a bowl of oatmeal for
              breakfast. Substitute bulgur, quinoa, wheat berries, or brown rice
              for your usual baked potato. When buying breads at the
              supermarket, look to see that the first ingredient is “100% whole
              wheat flour.”
            </p>

          <h3>Yogurt</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/yogurt.jpg" alt="Yogurt" width="400" />
          </div>
            <p>
              A good source of calcium and protein, yogurt also contains live
              cultures called probiotics. These “good bacteria” can protect the
              body from other, more harmful bacteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>How to include it: </em>Try eating more yogurt, but watch out
              for fruited or flavored yogurts, which contain a lot of added
              sugar. Buy plain yogurt and add your own fruit. Look for yogurts
              that have “live active cultures” such as Lactobacillus, L.
              acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, and S. thermophilus. You can use
              yogurt in place of mayonnaise or sour cream in dips or sauces.

          <h3>Cruciferous vegetables</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img
              src="images/vegs.jpg"
              alt="Cruciferous vegetables"
              width="400"
            />
          </div>
            <p>
              These include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower,
              collard greens, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, radishes, and
              turnips. They are an excellent source of fiber, vitamins, and
              phytochemicals including indoles, thiocyanates, and nitriles,
              which may prevent against some types of cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <e>How to include them: </e>Steam or stir-fry, adding healthy oils
              and herbs and seasonings for flavor. Try adding a frozen
              cruciferous vegetable medley to soups, casseroles, and pasta
              dishes.

          <h3>Legumes</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/legumes.jpg" alt="Legumes" width="400" />
          </div>
            <p>
              This broad category includes kidney, black, red, and garbanzo
              beans, as well as soybeans and peas. Legumes are an excellent
              source of fiber, folate, and plant-based protein. Studies show
              they can help reduce the risk of heart disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>How to include them: </em>Add to salads, soups, and
              casseroles. Make a chili or a bean- based spread such as hummus.
            </p>

          <h3>Tomatoes</h3>
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="images/tomatoes.jpg" alt="Tomatoes" width="400" />
          </div>
            <p>
              These are high in vitamin C and lycopene, which has been shown to
              reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>How to include them: </em>Try tomatoes in a salad or as a
              tomato sauce over your pasta. You can also put them in stews,
              soups, or chili. Lycopene becomes more available for your body to
              use when tomatoes are prepared and heated in a healthy fat such as
              olive oil.
